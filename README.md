# lc3-vm-rust

This is a **highly experimental** implementation of [LC-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3) virtual machine in Rust. To get it to a working state quickly, I wrote it by converting the reference C code to Rust almost line by line. I will do further modifications and refactorization along the way while I improve my programming and Rust skills.

Currently two sample apps 2048 and Rogue are working(barely):

```

To run rogue app:
